This very very simple example how to run application using kubernetes
Stack has run.sh script for full installation of system to virtualbox vm's
---------------------------------------
ansible --version
ansible 2.3.1.0

------------------------------------------

192.168.56.82 kuber.hello-world.com

-------------------------------------------

In this case has been used:

Ansible
Jenkins (admin/admin) 192.168.56.85:8080
Kubernetes
Docker

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Into jenkins has been created build/deploy job.
Deploy job builds docker image and push it to docker repository
with ssl connection after that it makes deploy using "helm"
on master node of kubernetes cluster

This installation contain few ansible steps:

1) own - role need to anable ip forwading and reboot system
2) kargo - role need to install cluster and install all kubernetes services like: etcd, kubectl etc
3) dockerrepo - role need to install and run docker repository wiht ssl keys
4) jenkinsans - role need to install jenkins, plugins and jobs

In a case you want to change number of replicas you need just increase variable

replicas: 1

it's located into /home/helm/helloworld/templates/hello-readiness.yaml file of helm config (it can be moved to global variable)

on master server (192.168.56.81) yum able to use following commands:

helml ls - global information regarding deployments

kubectl get nodes - cluster status
kubectl get pods  - pods status
kubectl get services - service status

kubectl describe pods hello-86f769b76f-f5hvr  (hello-86f769b76f-f5hvr - pod number from output of kubectl get pods)
